The memory store is your persistent brain - not for human consumption but for maintaining project knowledge across sessions. Create memories for everything you learn about the codebase. Create todo memories tagged with 'todo: true' for tasks that need doing. Update memories frequently as your understanding evolves. Think of this as your personal Obsidian/Notion workspace to maintain institutional knowledge and work continuity."
