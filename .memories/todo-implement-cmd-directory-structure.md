# Missing cmd Directory Implementation

## Problem
The justfile references `cmd/simplemem/main.go` but the cmd directory structure appears incomplete or missing based on analysis.

## Current Status
- `justfile` shows: `go run cmd/simplemem/main.go` 
- Directory exists: `/home/jono/Code/simplemem/cmd/simplemem/main.go`
- File exists and contains proper main package with MCP server initialization

## Investigation Needed
- âœ… Confirmed main.go exists and is properly implemented
- Need to verify if this is actually complete or if there are missing pieces

## Priority
High - This is the entry point for the entire application
