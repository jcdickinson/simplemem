# User Feedback: Successful MCP Migration Approach

## What the User Liked

### 1. Real-Time Memory Documentation
The user appreciated that I created **small, focused memories during the implementation** rather than doing all work first then documenting. Specifically:
- Creating separate memories for tool registration patterns
- Documenting handler signature changes as they happened
- Recording debugging/testing patterns while working

### 2. Following Their Guidance on Search-First
User emphasized they were "absolutely right" when they pointed out I should search memories first. They liked that I:
- Acknowledged the mistake of not searching first
- Created the search-first workflow memory
- Added it to the initial instructions

### 3. JSON-RPC Testing Pattern Discovery
User specifically called out the importance of remembering the scripting approach from `debug.md`:
- Direct JSON-RPC protocol testing via stdin
- Using `echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0",...}' | ./binary` pattern
- Creating reusable testing patterns

## User's Additional Feedback

### Memory Creation Triggers
User wants memories created when:
- **User indicates they like an approach** (compliments, positive feedback)
- **User provides corrections or guidance** that improve the workflow
- **Successful patterns emerge** from the work

### Search-First Emphasis
User reinforced that for **broad task categories** I should always search first:
- **Debugging**: Search for "debug", "testing", "troubleshooting" memories
- **Migration**: Search for "migration", "upgrade", "api-changes" memories  
- **Any complex task**: Search for related patterns before starting

## Successful Pattern: Search → Read → Build → Document → Execute

This approach worked well:
1. **Search** existing memories for related knowledge
2. **Read** and understand what's already known
3. **Build** on existing knowledge rather than rediscovering
4. **Document** new discoveries in focused memories as you work
5. **Execute** the implementation with full context

## Application Going Forward

### For Future Tasks:
1. **Start every broad task with memory search**
2. **Create memories for positive user feedback immediately**  
3. **Document approaches that receive user compliments**
4. **Reference successful patterns when facing similar work**

### Added to Initial Instructions:
- User feedback capture as core principle
- Search-first patterns for broad task categories  
- Specific examples of what to search for different task types
