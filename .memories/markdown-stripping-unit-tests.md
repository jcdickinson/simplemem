# Unit Tests for Markdown Stripping

## Test File
`internal/mcp/server_test.go`

## Test Coverage

### `TestStripMarkdown()`
Tests various markdown elements:
- Simple text (unchanged)
- Headers → plain text
- Bold/italic → plain text  
- List items → spaced text
- Links → link text only
- Blockquotes → plain text
- Code blocks → empty (code removed)
- Complex mixed markdown

### `TestStripMarkdownLength()`  
Validates character reduction:
- Plain text shorter than original markdown
- Compression ratio between 30-80%
- Ensures significant space savings

## Key Test Cases
```go
// Headers become plain text with spacing
"# This is a heading" → "This is a heading"

// Lists maintain spacing between items  
"- Item 1\n- Item 2" → "Item 1  Item 2"

// Links show only text content
"[Link text](https://example.com)" → "Link text"
```

## Test Results
All tests pass, confirming:
- Proper text extraction from markdown AST
- Appropriate spacing between elements  
- Trimmed output without wasted whitespace
- Expected character reduction ratios
